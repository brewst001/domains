The article is not short, but if you are already looking for a DNSSEC solution, I believe you will put the time in to read it. 
- you don't have to get very far before red flags start popping up about DoH.

Below is a link showing when the root servers enabled DNSSEC

Below are some sites that test DNSSEC if you are unfamiliar with the dig command in UNIX/LINUX

http://www.dnssec.cz/ should show a green key

http://www.rhybar.cz/ should not be reachable

If DNSSEC is not working and the certs are the issue, a method to re-obtain the certificates is by running this command

apt install unbound ca-certificates
I have not seen this happen in a while but some devices may not retrieve the certs.(installed on a laptop once. certs were skipped 
for some reason)



This section will contain some troubleshooting tips for Pi-Hole itself. This section covers one of the biggest issues I have seen 
most users have when they install Pi-Hole

Most ISP routers will not let you designate a DNS server on local or let alone private IP space. This aggravates me quite a bit. 
To ensure your queries are sent to Pi-Hole first. there a only a few simple steps you need to take.

Set the static IP from the Pi-Hole installation in your router's static IP section. each model is different. you may have to google 
how to do this if you are unfamiliar. If you are currently running DHCP and it is listed, most routers have a function to add it by 
clicking on the device and setting as static.(checking a box, hitting a plus sign, etc)

Turn off DHCP on the router itself. If you can still access the Pi-Hole while DHCP is disabled on the router, you should be fine 
to move onto the next step. Remember, DHCP entries can remain cached and a reset of the router would be the simplest way to ensure 
the cache is gone. At this time devices on your network may have issues using network services.

Turn on DHCP within the Pi-Hole web interface. Ensure to use a network range that doesn't include your routers IP address. The 
gateway field below the network range needs to be your routers IP address. In enterprise networks, I've seen the inside interface 
of the first layer 3 hop work as long as routing is configured properly in said layer 3 device(Router, layer 3 switch, FW, etc.) If 
that last sentence didn't make any sense, ignore it, it isn't for you.

Now check to make sure your devices can use network services. You may have to restart the device(easiest for average user) or use a 
method like release renew to clear IP information.

If those steps worked for you, you should start seeing queries in the query log section of the Pi-Hole dashboard. If not, make sure 
none of your devices are using another DNS service.


If anyone is interested, below are some additional links.

block list page that has a lot of lists to choose from:

https://blocklist.site/app/

Check if your Pi-Hole is open to the world. - check ports 53, 443, and 853. Or whatever ports you are concerned about. 
DNS is an easy target for most attackers and should not be accessible from the internet. If a port is open that shouldn't be, 
go into your router and ensure it is not in your port forward list. Or google how to block ports with your specific model. 
I explicitly block all 53 requests that come in and try to leave my network. My raspberry Pi is the only device allowed to 
communicate out over 853.
